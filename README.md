# Election-Analysis
Bootcamp challenge 3

## Project OVerview
To audit election results provided in a csv file, the Colorado Board of Elections has requested that a script is delivered that will calculate and report:
```
  • The total number of votes cast
  • A complete list of candidates that received votes
  • The total number of votes each candidate received
  • The percentage of votes won by each candidate
  • The winner of the election based on the popular vote
  
The Elections Board had a last-minute request to add a summary of the county vote data to include:
  • A complete list of all counties reporting votes
  • The total number of votes cast in each county
  • Each counties percantage of the toal vote
  • The name of the county with the highest voter turnout

```

  ## Resources
```
  • Data source: election_analysis.csv
  • Software: Python v3.7.6, Visual Studio Code v1.66.1, Git v2.35.1.windows.2
```

## Summary of the Code
This code origioanly reported the following to the terminal and creates a .txt file with the following:
```
  • Total votes
  • A list of each candidate, their % of the total vote, and their total number of votes
  • Election winner
  • Winning vote total 
  • Winning vote percentage
```  
The terminal output from the original code looked like this:

The .txt file looks like this:

After the request to include county data in the output, the terminal output is the following:

The text file generated by the script includes county reporting after the update:

### Election Audit Results

```
As shown in the opdated code output:
  • 369,711 votes were cast in this election in Jefferson, Denver, and Arapahoe counties
  • Jefferson County reported 38,855 votes for 10.5% of the total vote
  • Denver County reported the highest turnout at 306,055 votes for 82.8% of the total vote 
  • Arapahoe County reported 24,801 votes for 6.7% of the total vote
  • Charles Casper Stockham received 23% of the vote with 85,213 total votes
  • Diana DeGette, the winning candidate, received 73.8% of the vote with 272,892 votes
  • Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote with 11,606 votes  
```

## Further Utility of this Code

### Future Elections

This code can be used, without modification, to analize vote count data from any election for a single race provided that the csv file is structured in the same column format and has a header row:
```
  • Column 0: Ballot ID
  • Column 1: County Name
  • Column 2: Candidate Name
```
 
The script will work with any number of counties and candidates winning votes for a single race. Replace the election_results.csv in the Resources folder with a new csv file of the same name and restructure the columns if needed.

To test this, I added sample data to the csv file to include additional counties and an additional candidatebringing the total vote count to over 1 million. The script does not slow down to any noticable extent when extending the vote count from ~ 370,000 to 1,000,000 votes. Without changing any of the code in any way, the output is the following in the terminal:

The additional, modified data is reported in the text file output as such:

### MLB All-Star Ballot Analysis example

To further test the applicability of this code to scenarios beyond local election results containing three variables, I created a sample data set containing over one million rows of 2021 MLB All-Star ballot results. I created this in Excel using the RAND function to assign teams to the second column after filling the first column with serialized ballot ID numbers. Then I created lists for each team containing each teams' players that made the team rosters for the 2021 All-Star game and again used RAND to populte the third column with players from the corresponding teams in clumn two.

The only modifications to the code were in the PRINT statements so the output makes sense. Variables were unchanged and references to candidates processed player vote counts and references to counties correspond to teams.

The output shows that this code can be used to analize and report the selection of or from many groups (Counties/Teams) and for many singular selections (Candidates/Players) as this iteration of the code checks through 30 teams and over 100 players.

Two quick notes about this sample data: The RAND function in Excel is very good at randomizing with an even distribution. Because the teams were randomized first, the vote count for teams is pretty even. Additionally, players on teams where they were the only one on the ballot received a disproportional amount of votes as the row count for teams pretty evenly distributed. Players from tems with several ballot representative consequenlty all received fewer total votes compared to players that were alone from their teams.

The .txt output file is located in the Analysis folder HERE and the terminal output is as follows:

## Conclusion

This code is very efficient and functional for many uses without changing much. It could further expanded to add other variables. In the MLB example, player positions or team legues could be added and included in the output by either creating dictionaires or another column in the CSV data from readily available data.

Expanding this code to include additional varibles would be pretty straight forward and could include party affiliation or state-level information. Ballot measure results could also be analized with few changes.
