## Project OVerview
To audit election results, the Colorado Board of Elections has requested that a script is delivered that will calculate and report:
```
  • The total number of votes cast
  • A complete list of candidates that received votes
  • The total number of votes each candidate received
  • The percentage of votes won by each candidate
  • The winner of the election based on the popular vote
```

  ## Resources
```
  • Data source: election_analysis.csv
  • Software: Python v3.7.6, Visual Studio Code v1.66.1, Git v2.35.1.windows.2
```

  • A list of each candidate, their % of the total vote, and their total number of votes
  • Election winner
  • Winning vote total 
  • Winning vote percentage
```
